    "                              For example, A company collects data on the ages of its employees. To summarize the data, they                                 calculate the mean age, which is 35 years, and the standard deviation, which is 5 years. This                                   information helps the company understand the age distribution of its workforce.\n",

    "(ii). Infrential Statistics -  a method that allows us to use information collected from a sample to make decisions,                                          predictions or inferences from a population.\n",
    "                               for example-   A medical researcher conducts a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a new                                drug. They recruit a sample of patients and randomly assign them to receive either the new drug                                or a placebo. After the trial, they use inferential statistics to determine whether the drug had                                a significant effect on the patients' symptoms and whether the results can be generalized to the                                larger population of patients with the same condition."

Descriptive statistics are concerned with what the data looks like, and they are used to provide a comprehensive summary of the data.

Inferential statistics are concerned with what the data can tell us about the larger population, and they are used to draw conclusions about the relationship between different variables.

We could collect data on the amount of exercise that a sample of individuals engages in, as well as their weight loss over a period of time. Descriptive statistics would be used to summarize the data, such as by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the amount of exercise and weight loss. Inferential statistics would be used to test whether there is a significant relationship between exercise and weight loss, and to make predictions about the larger population based on the sample data. This could involve using a regression analysis to determine the strength of the relationship between exercise and weight loss, or using a t-test to compare the weight loss of individuals who exercise regularly to those who do not."

    "Measures of central tendency and variability are commonly used in statistics to describe a dataset by providing a summary of the data distribution. The three most commonly used measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode, while the most commonly used measures of variability are the range, standard deviation, and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values. It is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data normally distributed, as it reflects the center of the data distribution. However, it can be sensitive to extreme values (outliers), which can skew the mean towards one end of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the data contains outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. It is also useful when the data is not normally distributed, as it reflects the center of the dataset more accurately than the mean.\n",

    "3.Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is categorical or when there are distinct peaks in the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range is a useful measure of variability as it provides an indication of the spread of the data. However, it is sensitive to extreme values and can be misleading when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean. It provides an indication of how much the values in the dataset deviate from the mean. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability as it reflects the distribution of the data and is less sensitive to extreme values than the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in the dataset vary from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The variance is a useful measure of variability as it provides a more precise indication of the spread of the data than the range or standard deviation.\n"
